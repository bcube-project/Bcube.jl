# Conventions

This documentation follows the following notations or naming conventions:

- coordinates inside a reference frame are noted $$(\hat{x}, \hat{y})$$ or $$(\xi, \eta)$$ while coordinates in the physical frame are noted $$(x,y)$$
- when talking about a mapping, $$F$$ or sometimes $$F_{rp}$$ designates the mapping from the reference element to the physical element. On the other side, $$F^{-1}$$ or sometimes $$F_{pr}$$ designates the physical element to the reference element mapping.
- "dof" means "degree of freedom"
