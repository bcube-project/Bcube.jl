# Conventions

This documentation follows the following notation or naming conventions:

- coordinates inside a reference frame are noted $$\hat{x}, \hat{y}$$ or $$\xi, \eta$$ while coordinates in the physical frame are noted $$x,y$$
- when talking about a mapping, $$F$$ or sometimes $$F_{rp}$$ designates the mapping from the reference element to the physical element. On the other side, $$F^{-1}$$ or sometimes $$F_{pr}$$ designates the physical element to the reference element mapping.
- "dof" means "degree of freedom"
